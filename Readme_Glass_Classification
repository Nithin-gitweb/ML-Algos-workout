This Sub-repository contains the Machine Learning algorithm to achieve the following tasks

1. This has some exploratory data analysis and visualizations
2. A ML model is built which can predict the *Refractive Index* of a Glass. The model is trained in such a way that it learns from
various glass components and it's types. This predicts the numerical or decimal data and this model is developed by using Linear
regression method. The predicting ability of the model is pretty good. 
3. The type of glass falls under six categories. A model is built using Logical Regression techinique. 
The alogorithm merely uses Logical Regression technique and since there are six categories, the predicting ability of the model
it slightly poor. However using some scikit learn techniques, this model can be optimized so that it can predict significantly good
